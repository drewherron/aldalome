# Aldalómë

A dark, high-contrast colorscheme for Vim. The main colors are based (as accurately as possible) on phosphors of 70's monochrome monitors. The rest of the colors are exclusively from IBM's 4-bit CGA RBGI palette of the early 80's. 

So extremely under construction that it's not worth looking at yet.

Aldalómë [aldaˈloːmɛ] is a word in [Quenya](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3242291153.html).
